# C Programming Projects
ðŸš€ A collection of fundamental C programming projects, covering algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Created during my first year as an undergraduate.

# ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure & Contents

Each folder contains C programs categorized by topic.

## ðŸ”¹ [Hashing](Hashing/)

Implements hash tables using various hashing techniques.

Handles collision resolution with methods like chaining.

Example: [Hash Table Implementation](Hashing/hash_table.c)

## ðŸ”¹ [Math Computation](Math_Computation/)

Polynomial arithmetic and mathematical computations.

Evaluates and manipulates polynomials using linked lists.

Example: [Polynomial Addition](Math_Computation/polynomial_addition.c)

## ðŸ”¹ [Sorting](Sorting/)

Classic sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

Demonstrates efficient sorting techniques with C.

Example: [Heapsort Implementation](Sorting/heapsort.c)

## ðŸ”¹ [String Processing](String_Processing/)

String manipulation programs such as word replacement, comparison, and shifting.

Example: [String Replacement](String_Processing/string_replace.c)

# ðŸ”§ How to Compile & Run

Each C program can be compiled using GCC. Example:

```bash
gcc -o output_filename source_file.c
./output_filename
```

Example for Heap Sort:

```bash
gcc -o heapsort Sorting/heapsort.c
./heapsort
```
